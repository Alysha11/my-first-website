# My very first webpage

Welcome!

This page was created as part of my educational experience with the Code Institute.

It was created in Cloud 9 using HTML and a seperate CSS stylesheet. 

The website displays 3 streams containing developer languages and tools. The icons link to Wikipedia and the icon images come from various sources.
